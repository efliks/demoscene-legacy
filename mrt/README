 MRT Majuma's Raytracer 1.1
 --------------------------

1. What is MRT?
===============

MRT is a simple, small and portable raytracer. It allows you to produce
renderings based on text files. Each text file describes one scene: the
primitives (spheres, planes, cylinders), light and camera position.
The renderings are stored in 8-bit PCX file format. See example file for
details (scene1.txt).


2. Installation under Linux.
============================

Type 'gcc -lm -o mrt mrt.c' to make MRT.

MRT was written in pure ANSI C, so I assume no problems with compilation
under other OSs.

Note: although MRT compiles even on 16-bit compiler, it won't work (breaks 64k
segment boundary while allocating block for screen buffer).


3. Running MRT.
===============

Syntax: ./mrt [-r <resolution>] [-s] [-p <palette file>] file
        ./mrt [--res <resolution>] [--silent] [--pal <palette file>] file

If no errors detected, scene will be rendered and saved to file.pcx.

Available resolutions:
1 = 320x240
2 = 400x300
3 = 640x480
4 = 800x600
5 = 1024x768
6 = 1600x1200

Option "-s" sets the silent mode. No messages will be send to stdout.

Palette file is an optional text file containing 256 color 8-bit RGB palette.
The data format of this file is as follows (see palette.txt):

r1, g1, b1
r2, g2, b2
r3, g3, b3
...
rn, gn, bn
...
r256, g256, b256


4. Copying.
===========

MRT is released under GPL licence (see COPYING). Feel free to copy and
distribute this code.


5. 'To do' list.
================

a) 24-bit color
b) HSV color space
c) texturing
d) more primitives - hiperboloids, elipsoides...
e) boxes and polygons
f) reflections and refractions
g) multiple light sources
h) smooth shadows
i) postprocessing stuff (blur...)
j) ...


6. Tips.
========

MRT was not designed to be user friendly. My idea was to code raytracer easly
controlled via external scripts.

I use Python scripts to generate my scenes or to produce hundreds of frames.
That's the reason to use MRT :)


7. Changes.
===========

MRT 1.1, 13-08-2005
-------------------
* unlimited number of objects (now objects are stored in bidirectional list)
* new syntax in input files (new parser)
* improved syntax in command line
* added silent mode
* new palette file format
* added rotation of camera
* added depth shading

MRT 1.0, 09-08-2005
-------------------
* MRT released !




If you have any suggestions/bug reports - email me. But have mercy - it's my
first program written for Linux ;)


Thanks for trying MRT!
